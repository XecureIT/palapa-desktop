Manual test script

Some things are very difficult to test programmatically. Also, if you don't have adequate test coverage, a good first step is a comprehensive manual test script! https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com/web-application-test-strategy/

Conversation view:
  Last seen indicator:
    (dismissed three ways: 1. sending a message 2. switching away from conversation and back again 3. clicking scroll down button when last seen indicator is off-screen above)

    - Switch away from Signal app, but keep it visible
    - Receive messages to conversation out of focus, and the last seen indicator should move up the screen with each new message. When the number of new messages can no longer fit on the screen, the last seen indicator should stay at the top of the screen, and new messages will appear below. The scroll down button will turn blue to indicate new messages out of view.
    - Switch back to Signal app, and the last seen indicator and scroll down button should stay where they are.
    - Click the scroll down button to go to the bottom of the window, and the button should disappear.
    - Send a message, then scroll up. The last seen indicator should be gone.

    - Switch to a different conversation, then receive messages on original conversation
    - Switch back to original conversation, and the last seen indicator should be visible
    - Switch away from conversation and back. The last seen indicator should be gone.

    - Switch to a different conversation, then receive a lot of messages on original conversation
    - Switch back to original conversation, and the last seen indicator should be visible, along with the scroll down button.
    - Click the scroll down button to be taken to the newest message in the conversation

    - Scroll up on a conversation then switch to another application, keeping the Signal application visible. Receive new messages on that conversation. Switch back to application. The scroll down button should be blue, and the conversation scroll location should stay where it was. There should be a last seen indicator visible above the new messages.

    - Scroll to bottom of a conversation, then switch to another application, keeping Signal application visible. Receive new messages on that conversation. As new messages come in, the last seen indicator should march up the screen. Before it reaches the top, switch back to the application. This will mark those messages as read. Switch away from the application again, and receive new messages. The last seen indicator will scroll off the top of the screen as more and more new messages come in.

    - ADVANCED: Set up an automated script (or friend) to send you repeated messages. You should see the right number of unread upon entry of the conversation, along with with the last seen indicator. While the conversation is focused, new messages should increment the last seen indicator until it is offscreen above. Click the scroll down button to eliminate the last seen indicator, then scroll up. New messages received while scrolled up should not scroll the conversation, but will add a new last seen indicator and scroll down button.

    - ADVANCED: Set fetch limit to a low number, like 3 (in models/messages.js, fetchConversation function). Load the application, and don't select the conversation. Receive more than four new messages in that conversation. Select the conversation. The last seen indicator should reflect the total number of new messages and all of them should be visible.

  Marking messages as unread:
    - Switch to a different conversation, then receive lots of messages on original conversation, more than would fill the screen
    - Note the count before clicking into the conversation. Count the number of visible messages and ensure that the conversation's unread count is decremented by the right amount.
    - Slowly scroll down so that one more message is visible. The conversation unread count should go down by one.
    - Click the scroll down button. All messages should be marked read - even if you skipped a couple screens to get to the bottom.

  Scrolling:
    - If scrolled to bottom of a conversation, should stay there when a new message comes in
    - If scrolled to the middle of a conversation, should stay there when a new message comes in
    - When you've scrolled up an entire screen's worth, a scroll down button in the bottom right should appear.

  Scroll-down button:
    - Clicking it takes you to the bottom of the conversation, makes the button disappear
    - If a new message comes in while it is already showing, it turns blue
    - If a new message comes in while not at the bottom of the conversation (but button is not already showing), it should appear, already blue.
    - If you've scrolled up higher than the last seen indicator, then clicking the scroll down button should take you to the last seen indicator. Once there, clicking the button will take you to the bottom of the conversation, at which point the button will disappear.
